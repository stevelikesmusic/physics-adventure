## Physics Adventure Sandbox Game - Refined Specification

### Core Game Concept
Create an interactive physics sandbox where players can experiment with various objects, materials, and forces in a 2D environment.

### Key Features

**1. Block Construction System**
- Place solid blocks of various sizes and materials
- Blocks respond to gravity and collisions
- Different block types: wood, stone, metal (different densities/properties)

**2. Projectile System**
- Launch balls with adjustable force and direction
- Cannon mechanics for launching projectiles
- Real-time physics for trajectory and impact

**3. Vehicle Creation**
- Build simple cars using blocks and wheels
- Momentum and friction-based movement
- Ability to apply forces to vehicles

**4. Robot Mice & Maze Building**
- AI-controlled entities that navigate environments
- Pathfinding algorithms for maze solving
- Interactive maze construction tools

**5. Fluid Dynamics**
- Water simulation with particle or grid-based physics
- Tap-and-hold interface: tap water tool, then hold to pour/create water
- Water interacts with objects (buoyancy, displacement)

**6. Aquatic Life System**
- Add living creatures to water environments
- Simple AI behaviors for fish/aquatic life
- Ecosystem interactions

**7. Environmental Controls**
- Customizable backgrounds and themes
- Gravity adjustment settings
- Environmental hazards/elements

### Interaction Mechanics
- **Drag & Drop**: Move objects and adjust trajectories
- **Tap & Hold**: Water creation and sustained actions
- **Click & Release**: Launch projectiles with force visualization
- **Construction Mode**: Place and connect building elements

### Technical Considerations
- Use HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- JavaScript physics engine (Matter.js or Box2D.js recommended)
- Particle system for water simulation
- Spatial partitioning for performance optimization
