# Physics Adventure Sandbox - Project Design Document

## Project Overview
A comprehensive 2D physics sandbox game where players experiment with blocks, projectiles, vehicles, robot mice, fluid dynamics, and aquatic life in an interactive environment.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Physics Engine**: Matter.js for core mechanics + Box2D.js/LiquidFun for advanced fluid simulation
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas 2D primary, WebGL enhancement for effects/particles
- **Performance**: Quadtree spatial partitioning for collision detection and rendering culling
- **AI Navigation**: PathFinding.js with A* algorithm for robot mice
- **Audio**: Web Audio API with audio sprites for performance

### Rendering Strategy
- HTML5 Canvas 2D for primary rendering (compatibility + ease of use)
- WebGL fallback for particle effects and advanced fluid visualization
- Object pooling for dynamic entities
- Level-of-detail rendering for performance optimization

### Performance Optimizations
- Spatial partitioning with quadtrees
- Component arrays for cache efficiency  
- Lazy loading for assets
- Texture atlasing for sprites

## Game Architecture Design

### Entity Component System (ECS)
**Core Pattern**: Separation of data (Components) from logic (Systems) with unique entity identifiers

**Key Components**:
- Transform (position, rotation, scale)
- Physics (velocity, mass, material properties)
- Renderable (sprite, color, layer)
- AI (pathfinding, behavior state)
- Fluid (particle properties, flow data)
- Interactive (drag, click, construction modes)

**Core Systems**:
- Physics System (Matter.js integration)
- Rendering System (Canvas drawing)
- Input System (mouse/touch handling)
- AI System (pathfinding, behaviors)
- Fluid System (particle simulation)
- Environmental System (gravity, themes)

- Real-time pathfinding updates

**5. Fluid Dynamics**
- Particle-based water simulation
- Tap & hold interface for water creation
- Buoyancy and displacement physics
- Water-object interaction system

**6. Aquatic Life System**
- Boids algorithm for flocking behavior
- Simple ecosystem interactions
- Fish AI responding to environment changes
- Predator-prey dynamics (optional)

**7. Environmental Controls**
- Global gravity adjustment
- Theme/background customization
- Environmental hazards (wind, heat, etc.)
- Lighting and visual effects

### User Interface Design

**Interaction Modes**:
- **Construction Mode**: Place and connect elements
- **Physics Mode**: Interact with dynamic objects
