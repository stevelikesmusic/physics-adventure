## Recent Bug Fixes

### Robot AI Memory Leak Resolution
**Issue**: Robots exhibited erratic spinning behavior and caused browser crashes
**Root Causes**:
- Excessive force accumulation leading to runaway velocity
- Unbounded pathfinding creating infinite loops
- Memory leaks from setTimeout usage
- No population limits or bounds checking

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Force limiting (max 0.001 magnitude)
- ✅ Bounds checking with automatic reset
- ✅ Path length limits (max 100 waypoints) 
- ✅ Error handling in pathfinding
- ✅ Conservative AI settings (slower speeds, longer intervals)
- ✅ Robot population limit (max 5)
- ✅ Removed setTimeout usage
- ✅ Reduced update frequencies

### File Structure Resolution
**Issue**: Duplicate file structures causing cached/outdated code execution
**Solution**: Consolidated all working files to `/public/src/` directory structure
